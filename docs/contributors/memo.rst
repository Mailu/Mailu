========================

Update translations
-------------------

Mailu uses Babel for internationalization and localization. Before any
of your work is merged, you must make sure that your strings are internationalized
using Babel.

If you used ``_``, ``trans`` blocks and other Babel syntaxes in your code, run the
following command to update the POT file:

.. code-block:: bash

  pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k lazy_gettext -o messages.pot mailu

The, update the translations:

.. code-block:: bash

  pybabel update -i messages.pot -d mailu/translations

Please resolve fuzzy strings to the best of your knowledge.
