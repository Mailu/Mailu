## Description
<!--
Further explain the bug in a few words. It should be clear what the unexpected behaviour is.  Share it in an easy-to-understand language.
-->

## Replication Steps
<!--
Steps for replicating your issue
-->

## Observed behaviour
<!--
Explain or paste the result you received.
-->

## Expected behaviour
<!--
Explain what results you expected - be as specific as possible.
Just saying "it doesn’t work as expected" is not useful. It's also helpful to describe what you actually experienced.
-->

## Logs
<!--
Often it is very useful to include log fragments of the involved component.
You can get the logs via `docker logs <container name> --tail 1000`.
For example for the admin container: `docker logs mailu_admin_1 --tail 1000`
or using docker compose `docker compose -f /mailu/docker-compose.yml logs --tail 1000 admin`

If you can find the relevant section, please share only the parts that seem relevant. If you have any logs, please enclose them in code tags and in a section, like so:

```
Your logs here!
