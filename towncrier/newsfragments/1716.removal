Removal of HOST_* address resolution
The startup scripts will no longer resolve ``HOST_*`` to their IP addresses.
Previously, ``*_ADDRESS`` variables could directly be set by the user to override the startup address resolution. Since container addresses are not resolved at startup anymore, this override has been removed and ``HOST_*`` variables can be used directly.
