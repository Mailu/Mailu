  <p>The following steps will guide you towards downloading and using your
  configuration files. Keep in mind that you should review every downloaded
  file before running anything based on it.</p>
  <p>If you encounter issues while setting Mailu up, please review the
  documentation first, then check if an issue is open for that specific
  problem. If not, you may either use Github to open an issue and detail what
  your problem or bug looks like, or join us on Matrix and discuss it
  with contributors.</p>
