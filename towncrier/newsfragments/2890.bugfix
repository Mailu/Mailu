Setup:
Regular expression for checking the Mailu storage path was invalid.
Added checks to make sure JavaScript is enabled and that all JS files could be loaded. The setup site malfunctions if this is not the case.
Added server side validation of entered values in setup.
Simplified setup by removing the settings for configuring the WEB_* settings. Advanced users can still modify mailu.env.
