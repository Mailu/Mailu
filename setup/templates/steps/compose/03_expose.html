{% call macros.panel("info", "Step 3 - expose Mailu to the world") %}
<p>A mail server must be exposed to the world to receive emails, send emails,
and let users access their mailboxes. Mailu has some flexibility in the way
you expose it to the world.</p>

<p>Among Mailu services, the <em>front</em> server is the one accepting connections,
be it directly from the outside world, through a reverse proxy or in any
complex configuration that you might want to set up. It needs to listen on some
IP addresses in order to expose its public services. You must at least set up
an IPv4 or an IPv6 address if you wish to access Mailu.</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> You must use specific addresses, please
avoid generic all-interfaces addresses like <code>0.0.0.0</code> or <code>::</code>.

<p>You server will be available under a main hostname but may expose multiple public
hostnames. Every e-mail domain that points to this server must have one of the
hostnames in its <code>MX</code> record. Hostnames must be comma-separated. If you're having
trouble accessing your admin interface, make sure it is the first entry here (and possibly the
same as your <code>DOMAIN</code> entry from earlier). Also make sure that the first entry in
this list resolves to the IP address of your server, and that the reverse DNS entry for
the IP address of your server resolves to this first entry in this list.</p>
