Changelog
=========

2024.06.0 - 2024-06
-------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
For full details see the [releases page](https://mailu.io/2024.06/releases.html)

For the upgrade create a new docker-compose.yml file and mailu.env file via setup.mailu.io. After that any old settings can be reapplied to mailu.env. Before making any changes, carefully read the [configuration reference](https://mailu.io/2.0/configuration.html). New settings have been introduced and some settings have been removed. Multiple changes have been made to the docker-compose.yml file and mailu.env file. If Tika is enabled, then 1GB to 2GB of extra memory is required.

Before starting the new Mailu deployment, check the following two topics:
POSTFIX_LOG_FILE has been deprecated and is ignored by Mailu. If POSTFIX_LOG_FILE was used, then refer to the the new FAQ entry `How can I view and export the logs of a Mailu container?` how to configure similar functionality.

If a reverse proxy is used on the same host, consider switching to traefik using the updated instructions. Refer to `Using an external reverse proxy` on mailu.io. With these updated instructions Mailu will handle requesting all certificates. It is not required anymore to copy certificates from the reverse proxy to Mailu.

After starting the new Mailu deployment, check the following two topics.
The dovecot full-text-search indexes should be recreated:
From `bash` run:
```
find /mailu/mail -type d -name xapian-indexes -prune -exec rm -r {} \+
```
Via docker compose run (to force reindexing):
```
docker compose exec imap doveadm fts rescan -A
docker compose exec imap doveadm user '*'|while read u; do echo "re-indexing $u";docker compose exec -T imap doveadm index -u $u '*'; done
```

Check if the the hardened memory allocator can be enabled.
View the admin container logs via `docker compose logs admin`
```
WARNING:root:Your CPU has Advanced Vector Extensions available, we recommend you enable hardened-malloc earlier in the boot process by adding LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so to your mailu.env
```

**Only** if the above message is logged, then the hardened malloc can be enabled sooner by adding the following line to `mailu.env`.
```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so
```
Recreate all docker containers (`docker compose up -d`) for the changes to be propagated.


Please note that once you have upgraded to 2024.06, you won't be able to roll-back to earlier versions.

- Bugfixes: Upgrade to alpine 3.18.4: this will fix a bug whereby musl wasn't retrying using TCP when it received truncated DNS replies from its upstream. In practice, this has been seen in the wild when postfix complains of:

  "Host or domain name not found. Name service error for name=outlook-com.olc.protection.outlook.com type=AAAA: Host found but no data record of requested type" ([#2934](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2934))

- Bugfixes: Update hardened malloc as the original package is not available from alpine anymore.
  The newer version of hardened malloc requires AVX2: Disable it by default at startup and hint in the logs when it should be enabled instead.
  Upgrade snappymail to v2.29.1 ([#2959](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2959))
- Bugfixes: Fix letsencrypt on master ([#2962](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2962))
- Bugfixes: - Switch from fts-xapian to fts-flatcurve. This should address the problem with indexes getting too big and will be the default in dovecot 2.4
  - Enable full-text search of email attachments if configured (via Tika: you'll need to re-run setup)

  If you would like more than english to be supported, please ensure you update your FULL_TEXT_SEARCH configuration variable.

  You may also want to dispose of old indexes using a command such as:

  find /mailu/mail -type d -name xapian-indexes -prune -exec rm -r {} \+

  And proactively force a reindexing using:

  docker compose exec imap doveadm fts rescan -A

2.0.0 - 2023-04-03
---------------------

For full details see the [releases page](https://mailu.io/2.0/releases.html)

Upgrade should run fine as long as you generate a new docker-compose.yml file and mailu.env file via setup.mailu.io.
After that any old settings can be reapplied to mailu.env.
Before making any changes, carefully read the [configuration reference](https://mailu.io/2.0/configuration.html). New settings have been introduced and some settings have been removed.
Multiple changes have been made to the docker-compose.yml file and mailu.env file.

If you use Fail2Ban, then the Fail2Ban intructions have been improved. It is mandatory to remove your Fail2Ban config and re-apply it using the instructions from the [documentation](https://mailu.io/2.0/faq.html#do-you-support-fail2ban).

Please note that once you have upgraded to 2.0 you won't be able to roll-back to earlier versions

After changing mailu.env, it is required to recreate all containers for the changes to be propagated.

- Features: Prevent signups with accounts for which an SQL-LIKE alias exists. ([#2429](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2429))
- Features: Introduce TLS_PERMISSIVE, a new advanced setting to harden cipher configuration on port 25. Changing the default is strongly discouraged, please read the documentation before doing so. ([#2449](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2449))
- Features: Upgrade the anti-spoofing rule. We shouldn't assume that Mailu is the only MTA allowed to send emails on behalf of the domains it hosts... but we should also ensure that both the envelope from and header from are checked. ([#2475](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2475))
- Features: Implement the required glue to make "doveadm -A" work ([#2498](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2498))

- Features: New override system for Rspamd. In the old system, all files were placed in the Rspamd overrides folder.
  These overrides would override everything, including the Mailu Rspamd config.

  Now overrides are placed in /overrides.
  If you use your own map files, change the location to /override/myMapFile.map in the corresponding conf file.
  It works as following.
  * If the override file overrides a Mailu defined config file,
    it will be included in the Mailu config file with lowest priority.
    It will merge with existing sections.
  * If the override file does not override a Mailu defined config file,
    then the file will be placed in the rspamd local.d folder.
    It will merge with existing sections.

  For more information, see the description of the local.d folder on the rspamd website:
  https://www.rspamd.com/doc/faq.html#what-are-the-locald-and-overrided-directories ([#2555](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2555))

- Features: Drop postfix rsyslog localhost messages with IPv6 address ([#2594](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2594))
- Features: Isolate radicale and webmail on their own network. This ensures they don't have privileged access to any of the other containers. ([#2613](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2613))
- Features: Improved IPv6 support ([#2630](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2630))
- Features: Provide a changelog for minor releases. The github release will now:
  * Provide the changelog message from the newsfragment of the PR that triggered the backport.
  * Provide a github link to the PR/issue of the PR that was backported.

  Switch to building multi-arch images. The images build for pull requests, master and production
  are now multi-arch images for the architectures:
  * linux/amd64
  * linux/arm64/v8
  * linux/arm/v7

  Enhance CI/CD workflow with retry functionality. All steps for building images are now automatically
  retried. If a build temporarily fails due to a network error, the retried step will still succeed. ([#2653](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2653))
- Features: Add Czech translation for web administration interface. ([#2676](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2676))
- Features: Allow inbound to http and mail ports to accept the PROXY protocol ([#2717](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2717))

- Bugfixes: The gpg-agent package was missing due to updating to a new debian version.
  This fix adds gpg-agent back to the roundcube image.
  It is used for the enigmail roundcube plugin. ([#2117](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2117))
- Bugfixes: Fix CI/CD workflow. Tags were not set to the correct commit hash. ([#2124](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2124))
- Bugfixes: Fix a bug preventing mailu from being usable when no webmail is configured ([#2125](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2125))
- Bugfixes: Enable unbound by default. Mailu now requires a DNSSEC validating DNS resolver and experience has shown that this may not be the default everywhere yet. ([#2135](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2135))
- Bugfixes: Pin the root certificate differently for DANE. If you have setup a TLSA record following previous suggestion from Mailu please update it. ([#2138](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2138))
- Bugfixes: Remove the misleading text in mailu.env that zstd and lz4 are supported for dovecot mail compression.
  Zstd and lz4 are not supported. The reason is that the alpine project does not compile this

1.9.0 - 2021-12-28
------------------
For full details see the [releases page](https://mailu.io/1.9/releases.html)

Upgrade should run fine as long as you generate a new compose or stack configuration and upgrade your mailu.env. Please note that once you have upgraded to 1.9 you won't be able to roll-back to earlier versions without resetting user passwords.

If you use a reverse proxy in front of Mailu, it is vital to configure the newly introduced env variables REAL_IP_HEADER and REAL_IP_FROM.
These settings tell Mailu that the HTTP header with the remote client IP address from the reverse proxy can be trusted.
For more information see the [configuration reference](https://mailu.io/1.9/configuration.html#advanced-settings).

One major change for the docker compose file is that the antispam container needs a fixed hostname [#1837](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1837).
This is handled when you regenerate the docker compose file. A fixed hostname is required to retain rspamd history.

After changing mailu.env, it is required to recreate all containers for the changes to be propagated.

Please note that the shipped image for PostgreSQL database is fully deprecated now. To migrate to the official PostgreSQL image, you can follow our guide [here](https://mailu.io/master/database.html#mailu-postgresql)

- Features: Document how to setup client autoconfig using an override ([#224](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/224))
- Features: Add support for timezones ([#1154](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1154))
- Features: Ensure that RCVD_NO_TLS_LAST doesn't add to the spam score (as TLS usage can't be determined) ([#1705](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1705))
- Features: Add support for ECDSA certificates when letsencrypt is used. This means dropping compatibility for android < 4.1.1
  Add LETSENCRYPT_SHORTCHAIN to your configuration to avoid sending ISRG Root X1 (this will break compatibility with android < 7.1.1)
  Disable AUTH command on port 25
  Disable TLS tickets, reconfigure the cache to improve Forward Secrecy
  Prevent clear-text credentials from being sent to relays ([#1922](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1922))
- Features: Improved the SSO page. Warning! The new endpoints /sso and /static are introduced.
  These endpoints are now used for handling sign on requests and shared static files.
  You may want to update your reverse proxy to proxy /sso and /static to Mailu (to the front service).
  The example section of using a reverse proxy is updated with this information.
   - New SSO page is used for logging in Admin or Webmail.
   - Made SSO page available separately. SSO page can now be used without Admin accessible (ADMIN=false).
   - Introduced stub /static which is used by all sites for accessing static files.
   - Removed the /admin/ prefix to reduce complexity of routing with Mailu. Admin is accessible directly via /admin instead of /admin/ui
  Note: Failed logon attempts are logged in the logs of admin. You can watch this with fail2ban. ([#1929](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1929))
- Features: Make unbound work with ipv6
  Add a cache-min-ttl of 5minutes
  Enable qname minimisation (privacy) ([#1992](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1992))
- Features: Disable the login page if SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is incompatible with how Mailu is accessed as this seems to be a common misconfiguration. ([#1996](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1996))
- Features: Derive a new subkey (from SECRET_KEY) for SRS ([#2002](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2002))
- Features: allow sending emails as user+detail@domain.tld ([#2007](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2007))
- Features: rspamd: get dkim keys via REST API instead of filesystem ([#2017](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2017))
- Features: updated roundcube to 1.5 and carddav to 4.2.2 using php8 ([#2035](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2035))
- Features: use dovecot-fts-xapian from alpine package ([#2072](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2072))
- Features: Make the rate limit apply to a subnet rather than a specific IP (/24 for v4 and /56 for v6) ([#116](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/116))
- Features: Add instructions on how to create DNS records for email client auto-configuration (RFC6186 style) ([#224](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/224))
- Features: Remove the Received header with PRIMARY_HOSTNAME [PUBLIC_IP] ([#466](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/466))
- Features: Centralize the authentication of webmails behind the admin interface ([#783](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/783))
- Features: Add sending quotas per user ([#1031](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1031))
- Features: Allow specific users to send emails from any address using the WILDCARD_SENDERS setting ([#1096](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1096))
- Features: Use semantic versioning for building releases.
  - Add versioning (tagging) for branch x.y (1.8). E.g. 1.8.0, 1.8.1 etc.
    - docker repo will contain x.y (latest) and x.y.z (pinned version) images.
    - The X.Y.Z tag is incremented automatically. E.g. if 1.8.0 already exists, then the next merge on 1.8 will result in the new tag 1.8.1 being used.
  - Make the version available in the image.
    -  For X.Y and X.Y.Z write the version (X.Y.Z) into /version on the image and add a label with version=X.Y.Z
  	  -  This means that the latest X.Y image shows the pinned version (X.Y.Z e.g. 1.8.1) it was based on. Via the tag X.Y.Z you can see the commit hash that triggered the built.
    -  For master write the commit hash into /version on the image and add a label with version={commit hash}
  -  Automatic releases. For x.y triggered builts (e.g. merge on 1.9) do a new github release for the pinned x.y.z (e.g. 1.9.2).
    -  Release shows a static message (see RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md) that explains how to reach the newsfragments folder and change the branch to the tag (x.y.z) mentioned in the release. Now you can get the changelog by reading all newsfragment files in this folder. ([#1182](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1182))
- Features: Add a credential cache to speedup authentication requests. ([#1194](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1194))
- Features: Introduces postfix logging via syslog with these features:
  - stdout logging still enabled
  - internal test request log messages (healthcheck) are filtered out by rsyslog
  - optional logging to file via POSTFIX_LOG_FILE env variable
  To use logging to file configure in mailu.env
  - ``POSTFIX_LOG_FILE``: The file to log the mail log to ([#1441](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1441))
- Features: Make smtp_tls_policy_maps easily configurable ([#1558](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1558))

- Features: Switch to bcrypt_sha256, replace PASSWORD_SCHEME with CREDENTIAL_ROUNDS and dynamically update existing hashes on first login ([#1753](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1753))
- Features: Implement AdminLTE 3 for the admin interface. ([#1764](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1764))
- Features: Implement MTA-STS and DANE validation. Introduce DEFER_ON_TLS_ERROR (default: True) to harden or loosen the policy enforcement. ([#1798](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1798))
- Features: Remove cyrus-sasl-plain as it's not packaged by alpine anymore. SASL-login is still available and used when relaying. ([#1851](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1851))
- Features: Hebrew translation has been completed. ([#1873](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1873))

  - changed startup cleaning message from error to info
  - move client config to "my account" section when logged in ([#1966](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1966))
- Features: Remove Mailu PostgreSQL. It is fully deprecated. No images will be built anymore and it cannot be selected in the setup utility.
  The roundcube database flavour (e.g. PostgreSQL or SQLite) can now be selected indepently of the Mailu (Admin) database flavour.
  Fix bug #1838. ([#2069](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2069))
- Bugfixes: RELAYNETS should be a comma separated list of networks ([#360](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/360))
- Bugfixes: Fix rate-limiting on /webdav/ ([#1194](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1194))
- Bugfixes: Fixed fetchmail losing track of fetched emails upon container recreation.
  The relevant fetchmail files are now retained in the /data folder (in the fetchmail image).
  See the docker-compose.yml file for the relevant volume mapping.
  If you already had your own mapping, you must double check the volume mapping and take action. ([#1223](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1223))
- Bugfixes: Ensure that the podop socket is always owned by the postfix user (wasn't the case when build using non-standard base images... typically for arm64) ([#1294](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1294))
- Bugfixes: Fix "extract_host_port" function to support containers with custom / dynamic ports ([#1669](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1669))
- Bugfixes: Fix CVE-2021-23240, CVE-2021-3156 and CVE-2021-23239 for postgresql
  by force-upgrading sudo. ([#1760](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1760))
- Bugfixes: Fix roundcube environment configuration for databases ([#1831](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1831))
- Bugfixes: Alpine has removed support for btree and hash in postfix... please use lmdb instead ([#1917](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1917))
- Bugfixes: Webmail and Radicale (webdav) were not useable with domains with special characters such as umlauts.
  Webmail and radicale now use punycode for logging in.
  Punycode was not used in the HTTP headers. This resulted in illegal non-ASCII HTTP headers. ([#1952](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1952))
- Bugfixes: Ensure that we do not trust the source-ip address set in headers if REAL_IP_HEADER isn't set. If you are using Mailu behind a reverse proxy, please ensure that you do read the documentation. ([#1960](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1960))
- Bugfixes: Reverse proxy documentation has been updated to reflect new security hardening from PR#1959.
  If you do not set the configuration parameters in Mailu what reverse proxy header to trust,
  then Mailu will not have access to the real ip address of the connecting client.
  This means that rate limiting will not properly work. You can also not use fail2ban.
  It is very important to configure this when using a reverse proxy. ([#1962](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1962))
- Bugfixes: Fixed roundcube sso login not working. ([#1990](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1990))
- Bugfixes: The DB_PORT and ROUNDCUBE_DB_PORT environment variables were not actually used. They are removed from the documentation. For using different ports you can already use the notation host:port . ([#2073](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2073))
- Bugfixes: Ensure that webmail tokens expire in sync with sessions ([#2080](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2080))
- Bugfixes: Introduce SESSION_TIMEOUT (1h) and PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME (30d) ([#2094](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2094))
- Bugfixes: Hide the login of the user in sent emails ([#1638](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1638))

- Bugfixes: #2079 Webmail token check does not work if WEBMAIL_ADDRESS is set to a hostname.
  #2081 Fix typo in nginx config for webmail port (10043 to 10143) ([#2079](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2079))
- Bugfixes: Alias, relay and fetchmail lists in the admin interface were missing the edit button. ([#2093](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2093))
- Bugfixes: Fix bug introduced by enhanced session management ([#2098](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2102))
- Bugfixes: Fix build dependencies postfix-mta-sts-resolver. ([#2106](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2106))
- Improved Documentation: Document hardware requirements when using clamav.
  Clamav requires **at least** 2GB of memory.
  This 2Gb does not entail any other software running on the box.
  So in total you require at least 3GB of memory and 1GB swap when antivirus is enabled. ([#470](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/470))
- Improved Documentation: Added documentation for how to switch the database back-end used by Mailu.
  Added documentation for migrating from the deprecated Mailu PostgreSQL image to a different PostgreSQL database. ([#1037](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1037))
- Improved Documentation: Add documentation for Traefik 2 in Reverse Proxy ([#1503](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1503))
- Misc:  ([#1696](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1696), [#1712](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1712), [#1828](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1828), [#1830](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1830))


=======
There are some changes to the configuration overrides. Override files are now mounted read-only into the containers.
The Dovecot and Postfix overrides are moved in their own sub-directory.
If there are local override files, they will need to be moved from overrides/ to overrides/dovecot and overrides/postfix/.
See https://mailu.io/1.8/faq.html#how-can-i-override-settings for all the mappings.

One major change for the docker compose file is that the antispam container needs a fixed hostname [#1837](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1837).
This is handled when you regenerate the docker-compose file. A fixed hostname is required to retain rspamd history. 
This is also handled in the helm-chart repo.

Please note that the shipped image for PostgreSQL database is deprecated.
We advise to switch to an external PostgreSQL database server.
