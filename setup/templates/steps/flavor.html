<p>Mailu comes in multiple "flavors". It was originally
designed to run on top of Docker Compose but now offers multiple options
including Docker Stack, Rancher, Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Please note that "official" support, that is provided by the most active
developers will mostly cover Compose and Stack, while other flavors are
maintained by specific contributors.</p>
